# Getting started with React
In order to use React, I first studied the basic concepts of React and looked for lectures to actually apply it. This is the code that contains the contents I practiced while listening to the lecture.

# Why I chose the "class type"
There are two types of React implementation methods: function type and class type.
React official documentation recommends using functional types with hooks, but after searching the internet, it is better to learn class types first to understand functional types.
So, I want to learn the class type first, and then learn the functional type.
